# Porsche PCM 4.1 Carplay Full Screen hack. (Also works on Bentley BYG24)

Full screen hack for PCM4.1<br>
It should also work on Bentley POG24 MU.<br>

You have to install JDK 1.8 for compiling.<br>
Also you need prepare lsd.jxe from /ifs/lsd.jxe and convert it to jar.<br>
(There are some projects jxe2jar on github doing this. e.g. [https://github.com/spacemeowx2/jxe2jar](https://github.com/spacemeowx2/jxe2jar))

Compile it by using compile.sh<br>
Or you can use my precompiled jar.<br><br>

Put the jar to /mnt/app/eso/hmi/lsd/jars<br>
And it sould be workd.<br><br>

Tested in MHI2_TW_POG24_P08xx and higher<br>
